      <h1>Litany of Gendlin</h1>
      <p>What is true is already so.<br>
        Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.<br>
        Not being open about it doesn't make it go away.</p>

      <p>And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br>
        Anything untrue isn't there to be lived.<br>
        People can stand what is true,<br>
        for they are already enduring it.</p>
